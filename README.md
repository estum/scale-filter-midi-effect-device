# Scale Filter MIDI Effect Devices for Ableton

This is a script that generate Ableton MIDI Effect Devices that allow you to filter the piano roll in various keys and modes.

Disable the loaded device in Ableton to allow all notes to play, or enable it to prevent non-diatonic notes, both methods allow you to fold the piano roll. If non-diatonic notes are played, they will show up on the piano roll when folded, but without a &diams; symbol. You can move the non-diatonic note around the piano roll to find a diatonic note by searching for a lane with the &diams; symbol.
